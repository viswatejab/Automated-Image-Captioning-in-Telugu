# Automated-Image-Captioning-in-Telugu
This project presents an automated image captioning system that combines ResNet50 and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) features to generate detailed Telugu captions. By integrating high-level semantic features from ResNet50 with low-level visual details from DCT, the system creates enriched feature vectors for accurate captioning.
